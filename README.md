# SRCNN
Super Resolution CNN implementation with Keras

## Installation 
 * Keras
 * numpy
 * Skimage
 * CV2
 * matplotlib

## Concept
Working on blurred image ,this effect is caused by incorrect prediction of the new pixel values. 
The aim of a Super-Resolution neural network is learning the missing pixel values for the upscaled image as good as possible.
